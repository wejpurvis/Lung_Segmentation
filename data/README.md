# Data Directory

The provided DICOM files and corresponding segmentation files are very large. In keeping with best practises for software development, these files have been omitted from any commits to remote repositories. In order for the code implemented in this project to work, the `Images/` and `Segmentations/` subdirectories from the [Medical Imaging Github](https://github.com/loressa/DataScience_MPhill_practicals/tree/master/Dataset) should be placed into this folder.
