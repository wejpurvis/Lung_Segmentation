	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

	abstract = {Tomographic image reconstruction is generally an ill-posed linear inverse problem. Such ill-posed inverse problems are typically regularized using prior knowledge of the sought-after object property. Recently, deep neural networks have been actively investigated for regularizing image reconstruction problems by learning a prior for the object properties from training images. However, an analysis of the prior information learned by these deep networks and their ability to generalize to data that may lie outside the training distribution is still being explored. An inaccurate prior might lead to false structures being hallucinated in the reconstructed image and that is a cause for serious concern in medical imaging. In this work, we propose to illustrate the effect of the prior imposed by a reconstruction method by decomposing the image estimate into generalized measurement and null components. The concept of a hallucination map is introduced for the general purpose of understanding the effect of the prior in regularized reconstruction methods. Numerical studies are conducted corresponding to a stylized tomographic imaging modality. The behavior of different reconstruction methods under the proposed formalism is discussed with the help of the numerical studies.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Generation ({NLG}) has improved exponentially in recent years thanks to the development of sequence-to-sequence deep learning technologies such as Transformer-based language models. This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent {NLG}, leading to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, and data-to-text generation. However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before. In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in {NLG}. The survey is organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions, and (2) an overview of task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, and machine translation. This survey serves to facilitate collaborative efforts among researchers in tackling the challenge of hallucinated texts in {NLG}.},

	doi = {10.1109/DICTA52665.2021.9647209},
	abstract = {Accurate segmentation of lung fields from chest X-ray ({CXR}) images is very important for subsequent analysis of many pulmonary diseases. Deep Neural Networks ({DNN})-based methods have achieved remarkable progress in many image related tasks. However, their performance depends highly on the distribution of training and test samples, and they perform well if both training and test samples are from the same distribution. For example, {DNN}-based lung segmentation methods perform well on segmentation of healthy lung or lung with mild disease, however their performance is poor on lungs with severe abnormalities. Pulmonary opacification, which blurs the lung boundary, is one of the main reasons. A solution to this problem is data augmentation to increase the pool of training images, however despite the great success of traditional data augmentation techniques for natural images, they are not very effective for medical images. To simulate {CXR} images with opacification and low contrast, we present a novel image data augmentation technique in this study. To generate an augmented image, we first generate a random area inside the lung and then blur the area with a gaussian filter. Then, low contrast is simulated by adjusting the contrast and brightness. To evaluate the utility of the proposed augmentation technique, we applied it to images with different pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis and covid-19 from three public datasets as well as a private dataset and compared its effect on segmentation performance with traditional data augmentation techniques. Results suggest that the proposed technique outperforms traditional data augmentation techniques for all datasets on lung segmentation, in terms of Dice Coefficient ({DC}) and Jaccard Index ({JI}). Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation technique.},

	abstract = {Experienced radiologists can accurately diagnose relevant diseases by observing the cardiopulmonary region in chest X-ray images. Advances in deep learning techniques enable the prediction of lesions in chest X-ray images. However, deep learning-based algorithms usually require a large amount of training data, and it lacks an effective method for data generation and augmentation. In this paper, we propose a Lung Segmentation Reconstruction ({LSR}) module. A healthy chest X-ray image is generated based on the abnormal image as a reference. With the generated healthy reference, we propose a novel way of data augmentation for chest X-ray images. The whole images, lung regions and abnormal regions are stacked together and fed into a classification model to make a credible diagnosis. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the public dataset {CheXpert}. Experimental results show that our proposed abnormality enhancement can help the baseline models achieve better performance on consolidation and pleural effusion. These results highlight the potential value of the large number of healthy chest X-ray images in the dataset and the combination of different regions of chest X-ray images for prediction.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1076-6332(03)00671-8},
	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
To examine a statistical validation method based on the spatial overlap between two sets of segmentations of the same anatomy.

Materials and Methods
The Dice similarity coefficient ({DSC}) was used as a statistical validation metric to evaluate the performance of both the reproducibility of manual segmentations and the spatial overlap accuracy of automated probabilistic fractional segmentation of {MR} images, illustrated on two clinical examples. Example 1: 10 consecutive cases of prostate brachytherapy patients underwent both preoperative 1.5T and intraoperative 0.5T {MR} imaging. For each case, 5 repeated manual segmentations of the prostate peripheral zone were performed separately on preoperative and on intraoperative images. Example 2: A semi-automated probabilistic fractional segmentation algorithm was applied to {MR} imaging of 9 cases with 3 types of brain tumors. {DSC} values were computed and logit-transformed values were compared in the mean with the analysis of variance ({ANOVA}).

Results
Example 1: The mean {DSCs} of 0.883 (range, 0.876â€“0.893) with 1.5T preoperative {MRI} and 0.838 (range, 0.819â€“0.852) with 0.5T intraoperative {MRI} (P {\textless} .001) were within and at the margin of the range of good reproducibility, respectively. Example 2: Wide ranges of {DSC} were observed in brain tumor segmentations: Meningiomas (0.519â€“0.893), astrocytomas (0.487â€“0.972), and other mixed gliomas (0.490â€“0.899).

Conclusion
The {DSC} value is a simple and useful summary measure of spatial overlap, which can be applied to studies of reproducibility and accuracy in image segmentation. We observed generally satisfactory but variable validation results in two clinical applications. This metric may be adapted for similar validation tasks.},
